# Recipe App

This capstone project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In this project, I built a recipe-tracking app. 
This app allows a user to add a new recipe, display a list of current recipes, and delete a recipe from the list by clicking a Delete button.
